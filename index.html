		<p>Currently a senior at the University of Iowa with a double major in Business Analytics and Information Systems and Marketing, I've developed an interest in the structures of databases behind succesful marketing campaigns. Graduating next December, I hope to utilize this upcoming summer to further develop the hard skills that I need to become succesful in such an ever developing industry. </p>

 <p>
Having been born in the sunny state of California, I was not always a midwestern. In fourth grade my family relocated to a small town in France named Olivet, where we were to stay for the next three and a half years. Speaking very little French at the time, it was difficult to interact with my fellow peers. It was during this phase I developed the desire to learn how to use computers as a means to an end. I had recieved a lego mindstorms set and I remember the first application I ever developed was for a little robot to shoot foam balls at an intruder when they were to enter my room.
