		<p>Currently a senior at the University of Iowa with a double major in Business Analytics and Information Systems and Marketing, I've developed an interest in the structures of databases behind succesful marketing campaigns. Graduating next December, I hope to utilize this upcoming summer to further develop the hard skills that I need to become succesful in such an ever developing industry. </p>

Having been born in the sunny state of California, I was not always a midwestern. In fourth grade my family relocated to a small town in France named Olivet, where we were to stay for the next three and a half years. Speaking very little French at the time, it was difficult to interact with my fellow peers. It was during this phase I developed the desire to learn how to use computers as a means to an end. I had recieved a lego mindstorms set and I remember the first application I ever developed was for a little robot to shoot foam balls at an intruder when they were to enter my room.

After moving back to the United States, I took an interest in art. Specifically videography and photography. I began to make stop motion animiation films and enrolled in all the classes that my high school had available, including broadcast journalism. It was here where I first began to contimplate areas of study for my ever approaching college career. I chose to enter with a double major in Journalism and Cinematgraphy, taking computer programming

classes my freshmen year as elective courses. The next year I began taking electives in the Tippie College of Business related to Marketing. I had never considered business school, but these electives opened my eyes to that fact that business was much more than what it appears. 	
</p>

<p>
I slowly began taking more Marketing classes and declared at the start of my Junior year. However, after an internship with AEGON Global Technologies, I became aware of the importance of big data in the world of Marketing, so to increase my hard skills in this area, I have decided to attend the University of Iowa one extra semester in order to graduate with dual degrees in Business Analytics and Information Systems as well as Marketing.
</p>

<p>
When I graduate next December, I hope to find a job where I can apply the knowledge that I have gained throughout both my internship at AEGON as well as from the Tippie School of Business. I am also in the process of looking for something to do this summer, wheather it's an internship, part-time job, or a non conventional option, where I can further develop the skills neccesary to tackle my final semester at the University of Iowa.
